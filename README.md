This repository holds different projects and practice completed by Joy Dhairyalakshmi Gowda. Python is new to me and I just started learning language part-time in 2023 following Data Analysis course to use SAS Viya last year. Many tech jobs are now using Python because AI became focus for employment in technology. The exercises, games or practice are from one of several free Python video courses (from LinkedIn & YouTube) or books read, reading or completed that aren't forked off GitHub. I don't use Python everyday, but looking for remote programming employment now, so learning to think in code to make projects start to finish would always require effort. OOP language, C++, I knew before uses different syntax. JavaScript was last language I used in programming role in 2017. I heard from gossip that I was supposed to prepare for job since 2011, but I wasn't ever given message or opportunity to prepare because of the OTHER people present when news was delivered to a lookalike who rejected good tech job immediately. :-(

If something you found helps you, don't forget to tip your muse for good karma, ask me for correct CashApp or Zelle link (hint: both should have 904 phone number ending in 39), or donate to my Health Savings Account at Starship, which uses QR code, and should show my name. I'm identity fraud survivor, so watch out for scammers using my name and/or old emails. An ex and my SIL's are persistent about financial/economic abuse to leave me vulnerable to physical assault. I was stalked since 1989 or 1990 and it's certainly affected my career since I worked as manager of music store in New Jersey. I need a new job ASAP, but I'm patient in waiting for right programming or information technology job to become available. Taking survival jobs did effectively kill my programming career because I am identity fraud survivor who was able to convince others to use my degrees.   

Thanks for keeping me safe. You're awesome and you matter. I'm introverted and lose patience with people who wasted years of my life with psychological games. My life doesn't revolve around my desk, since I need work/sleep/eating/gardening balance. I don't use Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat, Instagram, Bigger Pockets or most social media channels. If the address isn't connected, then it might not be my page/profile. 

Have a great day,
JG
