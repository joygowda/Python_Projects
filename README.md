This repository holds different projects and practice completed by Joy Dhairyalakshmi Gowda are from 1 of several Python courses or books read, reading or completed that aren't forked off GitHub. I don't use Python everyday, but looking for remote employment now, so learning to think in code to make projects start to finish is taking effort. OOP languages use different syntax. JavaScript was last language I used in programming role. 

If something you found helps you, don't forget to tip your muse for good karma, ask me for correct CashApp or Zelle link (hint: both should have phone number ending in 39), or donate to my Health Savings Account at Starship, which uses QR code, and should show name. I'm identity fraud survivor, so watch out for scammers using my name and/or old emails. An ex and my SIL's are persistent about financial/economic abuse to leave me vulnerable to physical assault. 

Thanks for keeping me safe. You're awesome and you matter.

Have a great day,
JG
