#different projects and practice completed by Joy Dhairyalakshmi Gowda are from one of twenty or more Python courses or books read, reading or completed that aren't forked off GitHub.

If something you found helps you, don't forget to tip your muse for good karma, ask me for correct CashApp or Zelle link, or donate to my HSA at Starship.

Have a great day,
